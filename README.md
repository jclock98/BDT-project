# A big data system for the classification of physical activity level in the Italian regions

 Data about sport activity have often been connected through survey methods, which, however, have some critical issues (e.g., they are subject to social desirability bias and they do not allow daily monitoring of physical activity in a given territory). In this sense, spontaneously released data and data registered in mobile applications could represent a good alternative way to have more detailed information about physical activity of the people. For this reason, in this work, we projected a big data system for the classification of the physical activity level in the different Italian regions on the basis of multiple data sources.
